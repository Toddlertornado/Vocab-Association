                             Here at the vocab association, we strive to help students improve their vocabulary knowledge. We are given vocabulary words, and with those words we make stories. Reading stories helps kids understand and remember things because they have context to reflect on when trying to use the words. So, we use hilarious and frankly dark stories to educate students while giving them a fun time. If you would like for us to write you a story using vocabulary words, please ask us in the question section down the page.

	About Us:
We were founded at the beginning of the English Language, but our business really flourished when people had a hard time remembering certain words or phrases. We started with songs, so people could remember the words in the songs because tunes make things more interesting, therefore more memorable. We then adapted to the growing need of written stories and people knowing how to read, so we wrote down our stories. Around the time of the 1800s we reached what is considered our proudest moment. Our company president, Miss Tnediserp Ynapmoc discovered that people like stories that donâ€™t make a lot of sense, but are incredibly hilarious. So, we started making stories that have odd names like NDOAJDBVUIS and plots like when someone steals a pair of old boots that they want to use to hit someone on the head with it. Now, our weird plots with vocabulary words are better than ever. Our current president is Niotaicossa Bacob, who is actually a direct descendant of our original founder. She has been our president for the last 10 joyous years, and her term is almost up. Here at Vocab Association, we have a president who oversees all of our vocabulary work, and that president is decided by a board of directors. Usually the presidency lasts 5 years because we like to have different styles of leadership and writing, but she is so dedicated to our company that we just had to keep her as our president. If you have questions about her, please feel free to ask them in the question section below.
